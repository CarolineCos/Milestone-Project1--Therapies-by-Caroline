                <h3>Reflexology</h3>
                <p>Reflexology can benefit everyone from children to adults. 
                    It is a gentle non invasive treatment which involves applying pressure to the feet and hands. 
                    The whole body is mapped out on the feet and by stimulating the reflex points encourages the body to find balance and heal itself. 
                    It helps reduce anxiety and stress, improves sleep and balances the entire body.
                    Reflexology continues to work up to two days after the treatment.</p>
