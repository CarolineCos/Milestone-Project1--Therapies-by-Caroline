                Welcome to Therapies by Caroline. I am an experienced massage therapist and reflexologist based in Monaghan Town. I opened my practice in Monaghan Therapy Clinic in 2019 and have always been interested in complimentary therapies and started my training in 2015.

             <p>
                Massage and Reflexology are powerful treatments that bring relief from physical discomfort and stress. Each treatment is tailored for you, the patient, so that you get the most out of each session. I am trained in several types of massage and continue to engage in additional training. So whatever your preference whether it’s a relaxing and soothing aromatherapy massage, a more intense deep tissue massage or a holistic reflexology treatment, you will be looked after at Therapies by Caroline.
             </p>
             
             <p>
                I believe that balance brings harmony. However, life usually has other ideas so what life takes out let massage and reflexology put back in – a sense of calm, relaxation, and that elusive balance.
